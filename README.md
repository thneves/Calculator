# calculator

First release of the Calculator Project for The Odin Project.

Everything is working, but I am aware that code can be better. So I will keep working on this project.


# Bugs to fix

Set digit Limit to the display

Work with big numbers(operation function is cutting big numbers as if it were just a floating number)

# Improvements

Create a exponential button

improve percentage function

# Last

Make code smaller and clean
